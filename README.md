# Optimal Betting and the Kelly Criterion

This repository analyzes optimal bet sizing strategies when bettors have an edge over the bookmaker.  
Using the **Kelly Criterion**, we model long-term bankroll growth and compare it to alternative strategies such as flat and fractional betting.

## Key Topics
- Kelly Criterion theory and derivation
- Impact of misestimated probabilities and odds
- Fractional Kelly for risk adjustment
- Monte Carlo simulations of bankroll trajectories
- Visualization of expected growth and risk of ruin
